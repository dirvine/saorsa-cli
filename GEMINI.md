# Gemini Code Analysis

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Saorsa CLI Tools project, generated by Gemini.

## Project Overview

The Saorsa CLI Tools project is a collection of powerful command-line utilities for developers and system administrators, written in Rust. The project is structured as a Cargo workspace containing three main components:

*   **`saorsa` (in the `cli` directory):** An interactive menu system that provides access to all Saorsa tools. It features automatic binary management, including downloading, caching, and versioning of the tools from GitHub releases. It also supports direct tool execution.
*   **`sb`:** A terminal-based Markdown browser and editor with Git integration, syntax highlighting, and media preview capabilities. It offers Vim-like keybindings and a file tree for navigation.
*   **`sdisk`:** A cross-platform disk usage analyzer that helps identify large files and directories and suggests safe cleanup operations.

The project is designed to be cross-platform, with support for macOS, Linux, and Windows.

## Building and Running

The project uses Cargo for building, testing, and dependency management.

### Prerequisites

*   Rust 1.70 or later
*   Git

### Key Commands

*   **Build all tools in release mode:**
    ```bash
    cargo build --release --all
    ```

*   **Build a specific tool:**
    ```bash
    # Build the Markdown browser/editor
    cargo build --release -p sb

    # Build the disk usage analyzer
    cargo build --release -p sdisk

    # Build the interactive CLI menu
    cargo build --release -p cli
    ```

*   **Run all tests:**
    ```bash
    cargo test --all
    ```

*   **Run a specific tool with Cargo:**
    ```bash
    # Run the Markdown browser/editor
    cargo run --bin sb

    # Run the disk usage analyzer
    cargo run --bin sdisk

    # Run the interactive CLI menu
    cargo run --bin saorsa
    ```

*   **Check code formatting:**
    ```bash
    cargo fmt --all -- --check
    ```

*   **Run Clippy for linting:**
    ```bash
    cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
    ```

## Development Conventions

*   **Code Style:** The project follows the standard Rust formatting guidelines, enforced by `cargo fmt`.
*   **Testing:** The project has a suite of tests that can be run with `cargo test --all`. The CI is configured to run tests on stable, beta, and nightly Rust across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS.
*   **Continuous Integration:** The project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and includes steps for checking formatting, running Clippy, building, and testing.
*   **Releasing:** The release process is automated using GitHub Actions, triggered by pushing a new tag. The release script in `scripts/create-release.sh` helps in creating a new release.
